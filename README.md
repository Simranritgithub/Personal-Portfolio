My personal portfolio is divided into a public-facing website and a secure admin dashboard. The application is built using React.js with reusable UI components and a modern glassmorphism design, ensuring  smooth user experience.

The system implements authentication and authorization using JWT, where only authenticated admins can access the admin dashboard. The admin has full control to add, edit, and delete their own projects through the dashboard interface.

The backend is integrated with MongoDB for data storage, enabling efficient project management and secure data handling.
